# Warm-up calculator

A warm-up calculator for the work sets in the Starting Strength's program.

> As a general rule, it is best to start with an empty bar (“45” lb/20 kg), determine
the work set or sets, and then divide the difference between 45 pounds and the work-set
weight into even increments[^1].
